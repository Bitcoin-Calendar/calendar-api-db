 ized in BIP 16. They allow transactions to be sent to a hash code (an addre
 ss starting with 3) instead of a public key hash (addresses starting with 1
 ). \n\nTo spend #bitcoin sent according to P2SH\, the recipient must provid
 e a script matching the hash and script data. \n\nOne of the most popular u

DESCRIPTION:On February 18\, 2010\, Satoshi commented on Bitcoin's predeter
 mined supply. \n\n"In this regard\, [Bitcoin] is more like precious metals.
  Instead of adjusting the supply to maintain a stable value\, the supply is
  predetermined\, and the value changes. As the number of users grows\, the 
 value of each coin increases. This can lead to a positive feedback loop: as
  the number of users increases\, the value grows\, which may attract more u
 sers wanting to benefit from the rising value."\n\nReferences:\n["https://a

  #bitcoin played a significant role in Travis's fight against corruption an

 onsored by bitcointalk forum members. \n\nIt is also interesting that Kiger

DESCRIPTION:On June 5\, 1991\, Philip Zimmermann sent the first release of 
 PGP to several friends for them to upload to the Internet. \n\nSoon after P
 GP 2.0's release\, U.S. Customs became interested. Little did they know tha
 t they would thus contribute to PGP's growing popularity\, helping to ignit
 e a controversy that would ultimately lead to the lifting of restrictions o
 n the export of strong cryptography from the US.\n\nReferences:\n["https://

DESCRIPTION:On January 10\, 2011\, Satoshi explained to Mike Hearn the logi
 c he used in determining the emission rate and the total number of coins: \
 n\nIt turns out to be 10 minutes per block: 21\,000\,000 / (50 BTC 24 hours
  365 days 4 years 2) = 5.99 blocks/hour. \n\nI specified 364.58333 days in 
 a year. The halving from 50 to 25 BTC will occur after 210\,000 blocks or a
 pproximately 3.9954 years\, which is in any case an approximate calculation
  based on the best attempts of the difficulty adjustment mechanism. \n\nI c
 onsidered starting the emission with 100 BTC per block and reaching 42 mill
 ion in circulation\, but 42 million seemed too large a number to me. |I wan
 ted typical amounts to be in a familiar range. If you throw around about 10
 0\,000 units\, it doesn't feel like something rare. The brain works better 
 with numbers from 0.01 to 1000. |If the amount is very large\, the decimal 
 point might move two places\, and cents could be used as whole coins were u
 sed previously.\n\nReferences:\n["https://archive.bitcoin-calendar.org/arch

 tion for a cipher machine based on rotating wired wheels\, now known as a r
 otor machine. \n\nLater\, the machine became widely known to the public und
 er the name "Enigma". Its iteration was actively used for conducting privat
 e correspondence in commercial activities. \n\nModified versions of the "En
 igma" were later adopted by the German navy and army and played an importan
 t role in maintaining the dominance of Nazi Germany's military forces durin
 g World War II. \n\nDespite the fact that in 1940 Alan Turing developed the
  "Turing Bomb" ‚Äì a device for decrypting "Enigma" messages ‚Äì both machines 
 were constantly modified\, and in the field of cryptography\, as well as on
  the front\, a fierce struggle was waged for years.\n\nReferences:\n["https
