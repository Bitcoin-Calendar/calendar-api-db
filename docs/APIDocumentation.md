# Bitcoin Historical Events API Documentation

This document provides details for interacting with the Bitcoin Historical Events API.

## Base URL

The API is served from the root of the application. If running on a server with IP `213.176.74.147` and port `3001`, the base URL for all API endpoints will be:

`http://213.176.74.147:3001/api`

(Replace with `http://localhost:3001/api` if running locally).

## Authentication

The API requires an API key to be passed in the `X-API-KEY` header for all endpoints under `/api`. The server can be configured with one or more comma-separated keys via the `API_KEYS` environment variable.

## Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is applied per IP address. The current limit is 100 requests per minute.

## Overview of Endpoints

The API provides the following main functionalities:

*   **`/`**: Health check for the API.
*   **`/events`**: Retrieve a paginated list of all events, with powerful filtering by date (year, month, day, or combinations) and language.
*   **`/events/:id`**: Fetch a single event by its unique ID.
*   **`/tags`**: Get a list of all unique event tags and their usage counts.
*   **`/events/tags/:tag`**: Retrieve a paginated list of events associated with a specific tag.

Detailed information for each endpoint is provided below.

## Available Tags for Querying

The following tags can be used with the `/events/tags/:tag` endpoint to find relevant events. Note that tag searching is case-insensitive.

*   `clownworld`: Content related to traditional finance, banking sector announcements and activities, mainstream media narratives, and so on.
*   `cypherpunks`: Events, discussions, quotations, and news pertaining to the cypherpunk movement, including key figures like Satoshi Nakamoto, Hal Finney, David Chaum, and other early adopters, along with significant related activities.
*   `quotes`: Direct quotations featured within the event descriptions.
*   `bitcointalk`: Events or discussions from the BitcoinTalk forum.
*   `ecash`: Content pertaining to DigiCash, e-cash, or similar digital cash systems.
*   `lightning`: Events, developments, or discussions related to the Lightning Network or Lightning payments.
*   `onchain`: Events and discussions concerning on-chain Bitcoin transactions.
*   `obituaries`: Bitcoin obituaries events.
*   `trading`: Content related to Bitcoin trading, market analysis, or price charts.
*   `first`: Milestone events marking a 'first' occurrence in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

*   `privacy`: Content focusing on privacy aspects, technologies, or discussions within the Bitcoin context.
*   `development`: Events related to Bitcoin Core releases, protocol upgrades, and technical proposals.
*   `adoption`: Events highlighting instances of countries, governments, businesses, individuals, or organizations starting to accept or use Bitcoin.
*   `legal`: For events involving lawsuits, regulations, and government legal actions.
*   `media`: To specifically categorize mentions of Bitcoin in articles, TV shows, and other media.

## Language Support

Most data-retrieving endpoints support a `lang` query parameter to specify the language of the events to be queried. This feature is confirmed to be working.

*   `lang=en` (Default): Retrieves events from the English database (`events.db`).
*   `lang=ru`: Retrieves events from the Russian database (`events_ru.db`).

If the `lang` parameter is omitted or an unsupported value is provided, it defaults to `en`.

## Error Responses

Standard HTTP status codes are used. Common error responses include:

*   `400 Bad Request`: The request was malformed (e.g., missing required parameters, invalid parameter format).
*   `401 Unauthorized`: The API key is missing or invalid.
*   `404 Not Found`: The requested resource (e.g., a specific event) could not be found.
*   `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded.
*   `500 Internal ServerError`: An unexpected error occurred on the server.

Error responses will typically be in JSON format, like:

```json
{
  "error": "Descriptive error message"
}
```
